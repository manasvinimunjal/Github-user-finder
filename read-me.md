# Github Find User

## Specification
Build a simple interactive UI to display a list of a Github user's or organization's projects (based on search criteria) ranked by any meaningful metric you'd like and allow the user to browse recent commits on those projects.

## Running!
This project was built using HTML5 boilerplate for the extension of the project in the future if required. This is vanilla JS with jQuery.

To view:
 1. Open index.html in your favourite browser OR, alternatively
 2. Run npm install and npm start

### Manual Testing

#### HTML, CSS AND JavaScript Code Structure

* HTML - index.html
* CSS - css/main.css and css/modal.css
* JavaScript - js/main.js

#### Searching for an Organization

* Search for a user that is private or nonexistent to view the error message.
* Search for a user that is public, e.g. 'manasvinimunjal' and view the list of repositories
* Search for an Org that is public, e.g. 'github' and view the list of repositories

#### Viewing Commit History for a Repository

* A repository without commits will display a modal with a message that there are no commits to view.
* A repository with a commit history will display a modal with the most recent commits.
